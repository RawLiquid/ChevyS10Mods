Initial Commit for migrating to github

To compile this as it stands, you will need a few things.
1) Arduino IDE - should get the latest version *that is compatible with the teensy IDE addon* http://www.arduino.cc
2) Teensyduino - https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html
3) RoboClaw Library - included in repo
